            The API for "myFlix" is a server-side component of a movie web application that allows users to access
            information about movies, directors, and genres. Built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it
            follows REST architecture and provides data in JSON format. The API includes features such as registering
            new users, updating user information, adding and removing movies from users' favorite lists, and
            deregistering existing users. It also allows users to retrieve data about movies, directors, and genres
            through various HTTP methods such as GET and POST. In addition, the API includes user authentication and
            authorization code, data validation logic, and meets data security regulations. Optional features such as
            viewing information about actors and movies or creating a "To Watch" list are also available. Overall, the
            API serves as the backend component of the "myFlix" web application, enabling users to access and manage
            information about their favorite movies.
